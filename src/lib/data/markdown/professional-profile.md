# Professional Profile

I'm a senior full-stack software engineer with over 5 years of industry experience, specializing in creating scalable, high-impact digital solutions. My journey began with a passion for technology, leading me to pursue an intensive Full Stack Bootcamp at Israel Tech Challenge after studying Computer Science at Long Beach City College.

Throughout my career, I've demonstrated a remarkable ability to transform complex business challenges into robust technological solutions. At Cymbio, I've been instrumental in modernizing our tech infrastructure by developing a high-performance external communication audit service capable of processing over 50,000 records per hour. I've also enhanced our DevOps capabilities by implementing GitHub Actions and AWS integrations, and improved team efficiency through innovative monitoring solutions like NewRelic-Slack anomaly detection alerts.

One of my most significant achievements was at CityHive, where I led the development of an in-house CMS product built with TypeScript, Grapes.js, and Angular. This platform now serves over 3,200 active businesses and demonstrates my ability to create scalable, market-ready solutions. I successfully unified two backend infrastructures into a single Cloudflare Worker, now handling more than 10 million customers and 25 million requests daily. Additionally, I created an add-ons marketplace that increased the company's Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) by $100,000.

My personal projects further showcase my technical creativity and entrepreneurial spirit. The Songsterr Downloader, a web application for converting guitar tabs, has gained significant traction with over 50,000 daily users worldwide and has been indexed #1 on Google. I've implemented advanced features like PayPal integration and Cloudflare security measures, generating approximately $400 in monthly revenue.

Beyond my professional work, I've demonstrated innovation in various projects like Open Tunings, a web app for guitarists using Tone.js, and HumbleCompass, a cross-platform mobile app for finding vegan restaurants. My technical versatility is evident in my ability to work across multiple technologies, including TypeScript, Angular, React, Node.js, AWS, and various database systems.

I'm particularly proud of my achievement at the ITC Medical Innovation Hackathon, where I collaborated with data scientists to develop an AI-driven survey for detecting developmental delays in children, placing in the top 5 out of 30+ competing projects.

My technical skills span a wide range of technologies, including full-stack development with TypeScript, Angular, React, Node.js, and Nest.js, cloud services like AWS and Cloudflare, and database technologies such as MongoDB and MySQL. I'm passionate about creating efficient, scalable solutions that drive business value and improve user experiences.
